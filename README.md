# Vercel API for Fruit Data

This project is a Vercel API that retrieves and displays fruit data from a JSON file generated by a Python script. It includes functionality to modify the data as needed and provides a timestamp for when the information was retrieved.

## Project Structure

- `src/api/fruits.ts`: API endpoint for retrieving fruit data.
- `src/types/index.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for fruit data.
- `src/utils/database.ts`: Utility functions for data management.
- `data/all_fruits.json`: JSON data file containing fruit information.
- `package.json`: npm configuration file.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `vercel.json`: Vercel deployment configuration.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vercel-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
